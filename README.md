## Known Bugs in mmTour
- Narration not stopping when another narration audio plays (when skipping intro, restarting tour, or when moving to another section). This is a problem with Ruffle, not the SWF file.
- Exit Tour button not working. Ruffle/Flash is not allowed to close the tab/browser, so this button does not work. However, it may be reworked or removed later.
